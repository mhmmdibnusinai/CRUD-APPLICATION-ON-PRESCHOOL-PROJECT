## TADIKA MESRA INFORMATION SYSTEM (TMIS)
The business understanding and its background on how this program created, i solely saw an opportunity on digitalizing an information system on our user in a field of educational purposess in this case is a preschool institution. our user want to make a simplest program yet understandable, i profided a platform for them to stored informations thru databases which consist a database that stores student information and database to stored scores of student. it supposed for Homeroom teacher who want to store up information of their students.

# Brief explanation of main content:
1. **Show student data**, 
TMIS will help user to display desired data in a simplest way, wheter user could select   an entire data or a certain one so the user would easier to drawn informations thru TMIS.
2. **Add student data**, This is a command where TMIS given an order by the user to write a new data into databases with great readibility for user to input in.
3. **Update student data**, Update command is neccessity if the user want to access a certain value within data and changing its value, so the user do not have to delete the whole set of data.
4. **Delete student data**, TMIS would give an experience for accessing data and delete them if not neccesary or outdated data in simplest way.
